# Linear-Regression-Saratoga-Houses
The analysis was processed using R software and deals with the SaratogaHouses dataset from the mosaicData package. The aim of the analysis was to develop a model that describes the dependence of the variable price, which contains information about the 2006 real estate price in Saratoga County (New York, USA) in dollars, on a few selected explanatory variables. The dataset first had to be randomly split into training and test data. All the specified subtasks were performed on the training data, including the selection of the final model, which was then tested for quality on the test data.

Procedures such as polynomial regression, regression splines, and interactions were used in the search for a suitable model. Diagnostics of the selected model were performed, including analysis of outliers and influential observations, and verification that the assumptions of the linear regression model were met, etc. As criteria for model selection were used for example the adjusted index of determination or information criteria (AIC, BIC).
